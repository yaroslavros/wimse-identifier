For example, its not clear to me that the urn format is compatible: urn:example:container:db-read-replica.  This URN does not have a trust domain.  I think this will cause problems when defining how to use an identity.  IF the trust domain is not included then how does the consumer know what the trust domain is? \n\n\n\n",

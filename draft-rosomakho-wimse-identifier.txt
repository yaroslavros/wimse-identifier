Abstract

   This document defines a canonical identifier for workloads, referred
   to as the Workload Identifier.  A Workload Identifier is a URI that
   uniquely identifies a workload within the context of a specific trust
   domain.  This identifier can be embedded in digital credentials,
   including X.509 certificates and security tokens, to support
   authentication, authorization, and policy enforcement across diverse
   systems.  The Workload Identifier format ensures interoperability,
   facilitates secure identity federation, and enables consistent
   identity semantics.

1.  Introduction

   In modern distributed systems, workloads such as services,
   applications, or containerised tasks require cryptographically
   verifiable identities to support secure communication, access
   control, and auditability.  As systems scale across trust domains,
   administrative boundaries, and heterogeneous platforms, the need for
   a consistent and interoperable identifier format becomes critical.

   This document defines the Workload Identifier, a URI-based [URI]
   identifier intended to uniquely represent a workload within the
   context of an issuing authority.  The identifier is designed to be
   stable, globally unique within a given trust domain, and suitable for
   use in digital credentials such as X.509 certificates , JSON Web
   Tokens (JWTs, [JWT]), and other security artifacts.

   The Workload Identifier format is simple yet expressive.  It enables
   organisations to define trust boundaries, delegate identity
   management, and reason about workloads in a uniform way across
   service meshes, cloud environments, and on-premises infrastructure.
   This specification is intended to be generic and reusable beyond the
   context of any single system or architecture, including but not
   limited to the Workload Identity in Multi-System Environments (WIMSE)
   architecture [ARCH].

   The primary goals of this specification are:

   *  To define the syntax and semantics of a Workload Identifier.

   *  To establish requirements for issuers and consumers of such
      identifiers.

   *  To promote interoperability across different identity systems and
      domains.

   This document does not prescribe how identifiers are issued or
   verified.  Instead, it focuses on the identifierâ€™s format, uniqueness
   guarantees, and its relationship to trust domains.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Terminology

   The following terms are used throughout this document:

   Workload:  An independently addressable and executable software
      entity.  This may include microservices, containers, virtual
      machines, serverless functions, or similar components that
      initiate or receive network communications.

   Workload Identifier:  A URI-based identifier that uniquely represents
      a workload within a specific trust domain.  It is intended to be
      included in security credentials and interpreted within the scope
      of an issuing authority.

   Trust Domain:  A security boundary defined and controlled by a single
      administrative authority.  A trust domain establishes its own
      rules for identity issuance, validation, and policy enforcement.

   Issuer:  An entity responsible for assigning and validating Workload
      Identifiers.

   Consumer:  An entity that evaluates or verifies a Workload
      Identifier, typically as part of authentication or authorisation
      decisions.  This includes relying parties, verifiers, and policy
      enforcement points.

4.  Workload Identifier Specification

   A Workload Identifier is a URI [URI] that uniquely identifies a
   workload.  It encodes both the trust domain and a workload-specific
   path, enabling unambiguous identification of workloads across
   administrative and organisational boundaries.

   The identifier is designed to be stable and suitable for inclusion in
   digital credentials such as X.509 certificates and security tokens.
   This section defines the format, structure, and associated
   requirements for Workload Identifiers.

4.1.   URI Requirements

   A Workload Identifier MUST be an absolute URI, as defined in
   Section 4.3 of [URI].  The URI format allows different schemes (e.g.,
   spiffe, https, or urn) depending on deployment requirements.  Example
   identifiers:

spiffe://incubation.example.org/ns/experimental/analytics/ingest
https://trust.corp.example.com/workload/af3e86cb-7013-4e33-b717-11c4edd25679
urn:example:container:db-read-replica

4.2.  Trust Domain Association

   The authority component of the URI defines the trust domain which is
   responsible for issuing, validating, and managing Workload
   Identifiers within its scope.

   Workload Identifiers are interpreted in the context of the trust
   domain that issued the credential.  Identifiers with identical path
   components but different trust domains represent different workloads.

   Issuers within a trust domain MUST ensure uniqueness of all Workload
   Identifiers they assign.

4.3.  Stability and Uniqueness

   Workload Identifiers are intended to be stable over time.  An
   identifier assigned to a specific workload should not be reassigned
   to a different workload unless explicitly intended by the policies of
   the trust domain.

   Workload Identifiers are globally unique when the trust domain is
   globally unique.  This is typically achieved by using a fully
   qualified domain name (FQDN) under organisational control.

   For example, the following contains identifiers of two distinct
   globally unique Workload Identifiers

   spiffe://dev.example.com/ns/default/database/backend
   spiffe://prod.example.com/ns/default/database/backend

5.  Usage in Credentials and Tokens

   Workload Identifiers are designed to be embedded in cryptographic
   credentials and security tokens that are used to assert the identity
   of workloads during authentication, authorisation, and auditing.
   This section describes how such identifiers may be represented in
   commonly used formats.

5.1.   X.509 Certificates

   Workload Identifier included in an X.509 are encoded in the subject
   alternative name extension as a URI using the
   uniformResourceIdentifier field, as defined in Section 4.2.1.6 of
   [X509-PROFILE].

   For example,

   X509v3 extensions:
       X509v3 Subject Alternative Name:
           URI:spiffe://example.org/ns/default/analytics/ingest

   Consumers MUST NOT attempt to interpret or derive workload identity
   from other certificate fields such as the Common Name.

5.2.  JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

   When a Workload Identifier is included in a JWT, it MUST appear in
   the "sub" (Subject) claim, as defined in Section 4.1.2 of [JWT].

5.3.  Interpretation by Consumers

   Consumers of credentials and tokens MUST validate that the Workload
   Identifier is consistent with the expected trust domain and issuing
   authority.  Consumers SHOULD NOT make assumptions about internal
   structure or semantics of the identifier beyond the URI format
   defined in this specification.

   For authorisation decisions, consumers may map Workload Identifiers
   to policies or roles.  However, such mappings are out of scope for
   this specification.

6.  Security Considerations

   The Workload Identifier is intended to be used as a stable,
   verifiable identity for workloads.  Its use in cryptographic
   credentials means it must be protected against spoofing, ambiguity,
   and misinterpretation.  This section outlines security considerations
   for issuers, consumers, and system designers.

6.1.  Identifier Authenticity

   Workload Identifiers MUST only be considered valid when presented in
   a credential or token that has been cryptographically verified.  An
   identifier received outside such a context, such as a plaintext
   string in a request, MUST NOT be treated as authenticated.

   Consumers MUST verify the signature, issuer, and validity of the
   credential or token before considering Workload Identifier as
   authenticated.

6.2.  Trust Domain Validation

   Consumers MUST validate that the trust domain in the Workload
   Identifier matches an expected or explicitly trusted domain.  Failure
   to do so may allow identifiers from unauthorised domains to be
   accepted as legitimate.

   Where appropriate, consumers should maintain an allowlist of trusted
   domains or trusted issuing authorities.

6.3.  Identifier Reuse and Collision

   Issuers SHOULD ensure that Workload Identifiers are not reused across
   different workloads unless such reuse is intentional and well-scoped.
   Reassignment of identifiers to unrelated entities can result in
   privilege escalation or confusion in audit trails.

   Consumers SHOULD assume that identifiers are permanent within their
   domain of interpretation and treat unexpected reuse with suspicion.

6.4.  Information Disclosure

   Because Workload Identifiers may encode topological or semantic
   information, they may inadvertently reveal deployment details.
   Issuers and system designers should take care not to expose sensitive
   naming conventions in externally visible identifiers.

   Where possible, identifier paths SHOULD be minimally descriptive and
   avoid exposing internal implementation details unless necessary for
   interoperation.

6.5.  Wildcard and Prefix Matching

   Consumers SHOULD NOT interpret Workload Identifiers using wildcard or
   prefix matching unless explicitly specified by policy.  For example,
   treating all identifiers under prefix of spiffe://example.org/ns/db/
   as equivalent may lead to incorrect authorisation.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
